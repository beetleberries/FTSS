**Building Gameplay:**

- Ships are predesigned to make boarding gameplay more enjoyable
- Upgrades and abilities
- 10 ships on release?


**Ship Combat Gameplay:**
See https://playstarlost.com/
- Slow projectiles
- Aiming based combat with abilities/gimmicks

- Unsure about physicalise engines vs arcadey ship combat. But if doing phsicalised engines we must make sure that the player to first lost an engine doesnt instantly lose due to how poorly their ship handles

- Having power directional aspects. You can directly power to: Shields, Engines or Weapons for different benifits



**Boarding Gameplay:**
- Soul knight/Mobile legends/WildRift Controls (LHS circle pad, RHS buttons)
- Top down 2d shooter with stealth elements in gameplay

- When boarding, 30% of the rooms will be removed as the ship is "destroyed"

- Attackers can board ship anywhere excluding the cockpit center via a teleporter
- They can see crew positions while choosing where to board

- Once boarded Crew members can run to repair certain areas. Once 3 repairs are complete the Attackers get booted off the ship:
   - Other options include:
   - Crew gets wallhacks on boarders
   - Crew gets increased damage/healing/regen and becomes OP
   - Security system with turrets gets activated and processes to mow the boarders down

**Repairs:**
- Go up to a speech bubble, and hold down a interact button for X seconds while a loading bar fills up
- Repair locations will be randomly assigned on board for repeatability

**Rooms:**
When a bullet hits the ship the room that the bullet collides with loses HP
Room have a hp, when hp is depleted room get removed
Ships consist of 2x2 rooms or 2x1 coridoors

When players board the camera zooms in so that it is slightly larger than a 2x2 room




**Feature Creep that we probably wont get too <:kek:898157084695228447> :**
- Internal walls of the spaceship are destructible by certain abilities (nades)
- Crew can reinforce walls making then indestructible (like in rainbow six siege)
- External walls of the spaceship can be broken from ship combat phases and become not usable in the boarding conflict phase
