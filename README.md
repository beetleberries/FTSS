**Boarding Gameplay:**
- Soul knight/Mobile legends/WildRift Controls (LHS circle pad, RHS buttons)
- Top down 2d shooter with stealth elements in gameplay

- When boarding, 30% of the rooms will be removed as the ship is "destroyed"

- Attackers can board ship anywhere excluding the cockpit center via a teleporter
- They can see crew positions while choosing where to board

- Once boarded Crew members can run to repair certain areas. Once 3 repairs are complete the Attackers get booted off the ship:
   - Other options include:
   - Crew gets wallhacks on boarders
   - Crew gets increased damage/healing/regen and becomes OP
   - Security system with turrets gets activated and processes to mow the boarders down

**Repairs:**
- Go up to a speech bubble, and hold down a interact button for X seconds while a loading bar fills up
- Repair locations will be randomly assigned on board for repeatability


**Feature Creep that we probably wont get too <:kek:898157084695228447> :**
- Internal walls of the spaceship are destructible by certain abilities (nades)
- Crew can reinforce walls making then indestructible (like in rainbow six siege)
- External walls of the spaceship can be broken from ship combat phases and become not usable in the boarding conflict phase
